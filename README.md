# R-Spotify-Analysis
Exploratory analysis of top-rated songs using data provided by Spotify. Required working with a data set containing 200,000 rows. After exploring the data, I derived the rowSums, rowMeans, colMeans, and colMedians functions; derived a z_score function; performed a two-sample t-test and a one-way analysis of means; and conducted a basic regression analysis using facet-wrapping (the visualization for which is viewable in "SpotifyDataVis.png).
